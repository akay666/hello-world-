Week 1!
I am jinkai chen, and my nickname is akay. I come from China. my subject is engineering,so that is one of reason why I am taking this class.
My favorite is eating, so I have been many restaurant to try the special foods. Coke and car are very important in my life.
At the begin, I have to know what I learn from this course, so my inital understanding about Technical writing is introduction a stuff step by step
before my writing, I have to set up an account and repository on GitHub. The GitHub is a totally new stuff for me, so it takes me a lot time to do it.    
The technical writing on GitHub and normal writing on Word are really different. The technical writing on GitHub likes typing code. I have to make sure 
no gramma mistakes and spelling the words correctly. Also, the technial writing need more logical than the normal writing. 
"The programming Historian" and "Pierce Hacker" are really benefit on the new user. Those websites help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools,
techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching. The writers or the designers prefer to post their project in public websites. 
In a simply reason, they want to share their experience with others, and other people can learn different technical skills on those websites.
Finally, I think this week is really necessary because what we are study on this week will help me to finish technical writing in the future.
